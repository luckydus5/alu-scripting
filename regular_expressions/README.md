Background Context

This project focuses on building and practicing regular expressions (regex) using Oniguruma, the regular expression library used by Ruby by default. Since regex engines can differ between languages, all expressions in this project are designed specifically for Oniguruma.

The goal is to understand pattern matching by completing a series of progressively challenging tasks using Ruby scripts.
